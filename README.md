# GENII

Genii is an android app designed for memorizing information by playing with interactive flashcards that contains questions and answers.

## Some Insights

Currently, it's not on the Google Play Store but is planned for. 

Initially planned in Java, the project shifted to Kotlin due to its growing popularity and Google's strong support.

Object-oriented principles are employed to create flashcards, and data is stored using savePreference.

## Brief Tutorial

When you open the app, it takes you to the home page where your cards are. Since you start with none, tap the middle "+" button to add cards. A new interface will prompt you to input the question and answer. Saving creates and stores the flashcard.

To edit a card, be on the home page, and tapping the question title opens a menu. Here, you can change the answer or delete the card.

Now, for the play feature: it randomly selects a flashcard, displaying its question. Tap to reveal the answer, and it continues until all cards are visited.

## System Requirement

As of this moment, you will need android studio installed and the framework's emulator.
